TO DO

- make sure all enemies have same stroke color

- add siab room/project

- start profiltext y a little higher, i.e. y must be less. So android/wide doesnt look crappy


------------







IDEAS
?- only jump if releasing above character?
- signpost: personal projects dev this way
	- arriving at... 
	- signs saying all sorts of fun stuff?

- bg fade in?

- coin pickups 4 fun
- secret compartements with pictures in rooms
- let placed storyline chests drop from the sky
- evolve my armor over time
- invincible at start, but later not

? - boss style HUD health bar when fighting?
- epic defeat screen like loot?

DONE
x - more interesting enemy behaviors?
x - align cv with game
x - shorter load times /loader layout needed?

x - open pdf in another tab, it doesnt quite work to download it on ipad
x - do statemachine on room reveal
x - can performance be even better? physics is on?

x - check collisions on enemies, some are too small

IPAD/ANDROID
x qfo needs lower y values, check on wiiide scr

x - make sure I show the best pics

x - put in real skills and trophies 
	x - names 
	x - and placement in the storyline
	
x - pressing menu should prompt for approval

x - bug: when coming from game -> menu -> game, glitter positions wrongly. Also, glitter is not on when starting, even though there is new content

x - more enemies in one room?
x - skill and trophy pickup notification on sheet
x- no chest if lootids are empty on enemy
x - what if someone just runs past a boss? = USE LADDERS
x - can jump

x - add little after thought texts after projects to bind the narrative together
x - something about climbing in the storyline (not a project ladder)
x - hide menu hud item until needed

x - t junctions with signposts where you can go to different places?

x - fix sheet responsivity, it is not optimal in iPad aspect
x - when viewing a room, make sure view is centered correctly and 
x - Enemies in rooms
x - Arrange year verticals breaks with year labels (the storyline + rooms in sequence)
x - Arrange project rooms (the last ones + their content)

x - flag = info icon
x - items are typewritten in, presented oatt
x - can flag be a toggle instead so it doesnt activate when boss drops it?
x - ladders cannot work when room is not unlocked (visible)

STORY 1.0
*A long time ago - 8 years to be exact - I sought my fortune in the game development industry

Arriving at Serious Games Interactive I faced my first challenge

//Which turned out to be pretty hard

[FIGHT: QFO2]
We developed a strategy game, where players compete with AIs or players in building the most effective oil company in 5 global destinations. Played by more than 200k unique users.
(OLD)In this strategy game players compete with AIs or up to 3 other players in building the most effective oil company in 5 global destinations. Played by more than 200k unique players.

A success and a complex first project, which I learned a lot from. 
[SKILL: Agile Project]

Shortly after, I was handed the lead on another strategy game
[FIGHT: AR]
Players manage their own city, balancing stakeholders and water demands. Water plays an essential role as a resource and ecological denominator. 8 regional versions.

The game had a fairly technical backend and event engine, which I was part of architecting.  
[CHEST: skill]

Even though the first two projects had been very successful, at times it felt like I had to plunge into unknown territory 
[obstacels and fall]





The learning curve was steep
[walk up hill]

But exciting challenges kept presenting itself

[FIGHT: CP]
Puzzle game teaching 8-14 yr olds coding concepts through a treasurehunt thematic. Level editor and multiplayer. Nominated at Spilprisen 2017 (Best Learning game).
[CHEST: skill]
[CHEST: trophy - nominated]


[FIGHT: METRO]


[FIGHT: CAMBRIDGE]


At this point I felt able to navigate harder obstacles

[jump over gap]
[catch vines]



[FIGHT: LTR]


And I was able to take on new roles

[FIGHT: GHD]
[FIGHT: SIAB]

From here it has been all downhill

[walk downhill]

And I am eager to experience what awaits at the end of the line
