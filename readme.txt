STORY 1.0
*A long time ago - 8 years to be exact - I sought my fortune in the game development industry

Arriving at Serious Games Interactive I faced my first challenge

//Which turned out to be pretty hard

[FIGHT: QFO2]
In this strategy game players compete with AIs or up to 3 other players in building the most effective oil company in 5 global destinations. Played by more than 200k unique players.

A success and a complex first project, which I learned a lot from. 
[SKILL: Agile Project]

Shortly after, I was handed the lead on another strategy game
[FIGHT: AR]
Players manage their own city, balancing stakeholders and water demands. Water plays an essential role as a resource and ecological denominator. 8 regional versions.

The game had a fairly technical backend and event engine, which I was part of architecting.  
[CHEST: skill]

Even though the first two projects had been very successful, at times it felt like I had to plunge into unknown territory 
[obstacels and fall]





The learning curve was steep
[walk up hill]

But exciting challenges kept presenting itself

[FIGHT: CP]
Puzzle game teaching 8-14 yr olds coding concepts through a treasurehunt thematic. Level editor and multiplayer. Nominated at Spilprisen 2017 (Best Learning game).
[CHEST: skill]
[CHEST: trophy - nominated]


[FIGHT: METRO]


[FIGHT: CAMBRIDGE]


At this point I felt able to navigate harder obstacles

[jump over gap]
[catch vines]



[FIGHT: LTR]


And I was able to take on new roles

[FIGHT: GHD]
[FIGHT: SIAB]

From here it has been all downhill

[walk downhill]

And I am eager to experience what awaits at the end of the line
